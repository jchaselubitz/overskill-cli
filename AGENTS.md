## Overskill Skills

This project uses Overskill to manage reusable AI skills.

Before starting any task, read `.claude/skills/SKILLS_INDEX.md` to discover available skills. When a skill is relevant to your current task, read its full SKILL.md file and follow its instructions.

To manage skills, use the `skill` CLI command (run `skill --help` for usage).
